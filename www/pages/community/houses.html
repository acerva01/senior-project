            <h1>COMMUNITY HOUSES</h1>


            <p>The Newman Community Houses are small Catholic Christian communities made up of students who live together while going to school here in San Luis Obispo. Each year students who choose to live in these houses and grow in their Christian faith, walk with other Catholics who are striving to do the same. The Community Houses began in 1983 by Father Vincent Walsh when he established the St. Joseph House. Since then, other houses have been established patterned on the St. Joseph House model. Currently there are four community houses: St. Joseph House, Faith House, Casa Maria, and Casa Romero. These houses have evolved through the initiatives of members of the Newman Community, as well as the wider Catholic Community of San Luis Obispo. We believe this development to be the work of the Holy Spirit in our midst.
            </p>

            <h3>Vision for these Communities</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>students live as faithful witnesses of the Catholic Christian (practicing Catholic) way of life through the sharing of their lives and prayer together.</li>
                <li>That students be encouraged to come together as a community to worship at the Sunday College Mass and be actively involved in Newman activities and service.</li>
                <li>hat students be faithful to each other in the living of their house Covenants / Mission Statements.</li>
                <li>That the houses become centers of hospitality for other students seeking friendship and community.</li>
                <li>That each house work to create an atmosphere of friendship, respect, and trust in their neighborhood.</li>
                <li>That each house member actively participates in their house's responsibility toward the Newman Center.</li>

            <p>The Saint Joseph House honors the example of Saint Joseph the patron of the Universal Church. His love and strength as a father and husband created a welcoming home for Jesus and Mary. As the model worker, Saint Joseph provided a safe and loving home in which the Son of God grew to proclaim the Gospel to the world. The Saint Joseph House is home for college students whose commitment is to develop and live as a Catholic Christian family.
            </p>

We the Saint Joseph house commit ourselves to follow this example by welcoming the community into our home and encouraging all to live lives of faith. In his spirit, we strive to lead holy lives and to lead others to a deeper relationship with Christ.
            </p>
